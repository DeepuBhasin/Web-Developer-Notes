2. Post : The Post Method is used to make a new entry in the database Example Add a new book

3. Put :  The Put Method is used to update all the properties of current resource in the database example update all properties (column) of an existing book etc.

4. Patch : The Patch Method is similar to put but it is used to update partial properties of current resource in the database Example update few properties (columns) of an existing book etc.

5. Delete : The Delete Method is used to delete the resource from the database. There are two types for delete

   1. Soft delete : Here we will use patch method to update an existing book from database like isVisible

   2. Hard Delete : Here we will use delete method to delete an existing book from database etc.

### ðŸ“˜Status Code

* Status code are issued from the server and they gives the information about the responses

* All HTTP response status code are divided into five categories

  1. 1xx - Information response

  2. 2xx - Successful

  3. 3xx - Redirection

  4. 4xx - Client error

  5. 5xx - Server error

  4. 301 : Moved Permanently

  5. 302 : Moved Temporarily

  6. 400 : Bad Request (because we send wrong data in HTTP request)

  7. 401 : Unauthorized (If you looking for a resource that don't have access in that situation it will return 401)

  8. 404 : Not Found (If you looking for a resource that does not exist example if you looking for a required with specific id which does not exist in database in that case it will return 404)

  9. 405 : Methods not allowed (instead of GET you are using POST)

  10. 500 : Internal server error (all errors on server)

  11. 503 : Service unavailable (ex - down for maintenance)
