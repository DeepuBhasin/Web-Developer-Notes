## 📘What is DOM
* *In Simple words DOM is basically a connection point between HTML documents and Javascript Code. *
* DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads and it's stored in a tree structure like in the given image, in this each html element is one object

* **DOM** and **DOM Methods** are actually part of something called the **web APIs**. so the web API are like **libraries** that browsers implement and that we can access from our javascript.
* Web Api are basically libraries that are also written in javascript and that are automatically available for us to use.
* And there is actually an official DOM specification that browser implement, which is the reason why DOM manipulation works the same in all browsers.
* There are various API like timer, fetch

## 📘Event Listeners
* An Event is something that happens on the page for example a mouse click, or a mouse moving or a key press or many other events Then with an event listener we can wait for a certain event to happen and then react to it.

```html 
<button id="btn"> Click Me</button>
<script>
    let btn = document.querySelector("#btn");
    btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
        alert("Hello World")
    })
</script>
```
⚠️ **Note :** when ever you get *any value* from DOM  the *type* of that value is always **string**
