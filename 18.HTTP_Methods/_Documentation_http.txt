Client-Serever Architecture 
    Server 
        Machine or component that is the service provider and provides uninterrupted services to the client as per request.

     Client 
        Machine or component that request for the service and receive service.

    1. Client Server Architecture in the other words, Seperation of Concerns
    2. Both many be impleemented and deployed independenty, using any language or technology 
    3. Both could be different such as window,Linux or Mac
    4. While sending and receiving request, there should be well defined communication protocol, common format of request and Response and error handling machanism       


Protocol
    When client And Browser Connect with each other they use same languge and Some kind of Rules like grammer  etc this is called. Like in Real world we use any kind of Language to Communicate with each other in Computer world language is Called Protocol
    there are many protocol 
        1. FTP 
        2. HTTP (most popular)
        3. web socket
        4. SMTP

What is web Resource 
    its a Document like HTML , PDF , JSON document etc and these document Client can access through Web server 
        a. static Resource  -> not using Database
        b. Dyanimc Resource -> using of Database

Http Transaction (connection Cycle)
    When ever Client Request for any web Resource , first Connection is on then then request is send then Response back server then Connection is close
