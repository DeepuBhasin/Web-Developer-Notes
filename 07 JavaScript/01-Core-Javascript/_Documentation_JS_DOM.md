### üìòInformation

* The DOM is often referred as DOM Tree (the tree contains thousand of object called as nodes example head node body node etc)

* If you want to work in a browser environment, it's essential to understand the DOM (Document Object Model). However, on the Node.js side, understanding the DOM is not necessary.

* Best Example to Understand DOM Tree (parent, child, siblings)

### üìòWhat is the DOM? & How the DOM Works


**What is the DOM?**

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a way to represent a web page as a tree of objects.

**How it Works**

1. **Loading**: When a browser loads a web page, it reads the HTML and creates a tree-like structure called the DOM.
2. **Structure**: This tree has nodes for each part of the page (e.g., elements like \<div>, \<p>, attributes, and text).
3. **Manipulation**: JavaScript can use the DOM to change the page. For example, it can add or remove elements, change text, or modify styles.
In simple terms, the DOM lets you use JavaScript to make your web page dynamic and interactive by changing the content and structure on the fly.

---

### üìòDocument Object

The window object is the global object in a web browser. The document object, which is part of the window, contains all the properties and methods needed to access and manipulate HTML elements.

To access the document object, you can use:

```js
window.document

// OR

document
```
Both references point to the same object, making it easy to work with the structure and content of a webpage.

---

### üìòconsole.log() vs console.dir for document
* **console.log()**: Displays the element in a readable format, showing its HTML structure.

* **console.dir()**: Displays the element as a JavaScript object, showing its properties and methods.

Use console.log() to see the element as it appears in the HTML, and use console.dir() to explore its detailed JavaScript object structure.

```js
document

// or

console.log(document)
```

```js
console.dir(document)
```

### üìò DOM vs Html Vs Javascript Vs BOM

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

    * What it is: The standard language used to create and structure web pages.

    * Purpose: Defines the structure and content of a web page (e.g., paragraphs, headings, links, images).

    * Example: \<p>This is a paragraph.\</p>


2. JavaScript

    * What it is: A programming language used to create interactive and dynamic content on web pages.

   * Purpose: Adds functionality and behavior to web pages (e.g., form validation, animations, responding to user actions).

   * Example: document.getElementById("myButton").onclick = function() { alert("Button clicked!"); };

3. DOM (Document Object Model)
    * What it is: A programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

   * Purpose: Represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing JavaScript to access and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a web page.

   * Example: document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";

4. BOM (Browser Object Model)
   * What it is: A set of objects provided by the browser to interact with the web browser itself (outside of the document content).

   * Purpose: Allows JavaScript to interact with the browser (e.g., control the browser window, manage cookies, retrieve browser information).

   * Example: window.alert("This is a BOM example!");

Summary

* HTML defines what elements appear on a web page.

* JavaScript makes those elements interactive.

* DOM is the bridge that lets JavaScript interact with and modify the HTML content.
* BOM is how JavaScript interacts with the browser outside of the web page content (like alert boxes and browser navigation).

### üìòWhats is DOM API ?

* A DOM API (Document Object Model Application Programming Interface) is a set of tools that allows developers to interact with and manipulate the structure, style, and content of web pages using programming languages like JavaScript.

* It plays a role of bridge in between Javascript and Browser.

### üìòDOM Vs Critical Render Vs CSSOM VS Node

1. DOM Tree

    DOM (Document Object Model) Tree:

    * It's a tree-like structure that represents the content of a web page.

    * The tree is made up of nodes, which can be elements, attributes, or text.

    Example:

    Imagine you have this HTML:

    ```html
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    The DOM tree for this HTML looks like this:

    ```css
    html
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ body
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ h1
        ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Text: "Hello World"
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ p
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Text: "This is a paragraph."
    ```


2. Render Tree

    Render Tree:

    * It's another tree structure used by the browser to display the web page.

    * It combines the visual aspects (CSS) with the content from the DOM.

    * Only visible elements are included in the render tree (e.g., hidden elements in the DOM won't be in the render tree).

    Example:

    Using the same HTML with some CSS:

    ```html
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1 style="display:none;">Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    The render tree will look like this:

    ```css
    body
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ p
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Text: "This is a paragraph."
    ```

3. CSSOM

    CSSOM (CSS Object Model) Tree represents the styles for the document. It is built from all the CSS rules in the document and any styles applied directly to the elements

    ```css
    h1 {
        color: blue;
    }
    p {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
    ```
    CSSOM Tree:

    ```css
    h1 {
        color: blue;
    }
    p {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
    ```

4. Node in DOM

    Node in DOM:

    * A node is a single point in the DOM tree.

    * It can be an element (like \<p>), text within an element, or even an attribute.

    Example:

    In the HTML example above:

    * The \<html> tag is a node.

    * The \<body> tag is a node.

    * The text "Hello World" is a text node within the \<h1> element.

    * The style="display:none;" is an attribute node of the \<h1> element.

In summary:

* The DOM tree represents all the content of the web page.
* The render tree represents only the parts of the content that are visible and styled.
* A node in the DOM is any single item in the DOM tree, like an element, text, or attribute.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note :** The DOM has to consists the HTML code and the HTML spec required that all content must be inside in body tag.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note :** on HtmlCollection forEach loop will not work only native for-loop will work, but on NodeList both will work

**Apply JS on the fly**

```html
<div id="first-name">Deep</div>
<div class="header">header 1</div>
<div class="header">header 2</div>

    firstName.style.background = 'red';
    firstName.style.color = 'white'

    const headers = document.getElementsByClassName('header');
    for (let i = 0; i < headers.length; i++) {
        headers[i].style.border = '1px solid black';
        headers[i].style.padding = '10px';
    }
</script>
```

### üìò Whats is node and How can Access

* A text node is a part of the HTML structure that contains only text. It's the actual text content you see between the HTML tags.

* Each node can have html attributes. Nodes can also have content including other nodes and text.

**Why You Are Getting Text Nodes:**

When you have spaces, tabs, or newlines between HTML elements, the browser treats these as text nodes. In your HTML:


```html
<body>
    <div id="first-name">Deep</div>
    <div class="header">header 1</div>
    <div class="header">header 2</div>
</body>
```

The spaces and newlines between the \<div> elements are counted as text nodes. So, when you look at the childNodes of the \<body> element, you see these text nodes along with the actual \<div> elements.

Example:

Imagine you have this simplified HTML:

```html
<div>Hello</div>

```

The DOM structure would be:

```css
div
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Hello
```

Here, the text node contains the word "Hello."

In your case, the newlines and spaces are also text nodes, even though they don't contain visible text. They look like this:

* "\n " (a newline and spaces)

* "\n " (another newline and spaces)

**Why They Matter:**

its because every character in the document has to eventually become part of the DOM like spaces and newlines are valid characters

This is because for the critical rendering process we had to form render tree. In order to display the data in browser, a render tree has to be constructed and part of that render tree is to combine DOM with CSSOM and in this forming of DOM we need to include all the characters within your html. In short, we need every character to from part of our DOM and that's why new lines or spaces are included in our nodes.


* **Preserving Formatting :** Text nodes keep the formatting of your HTML (like spaces and newlines are valid characters).
* **Accessing Content :** Text nodes let you access and change the text inside your elements.

**How can access**

```html
<body>
    <div id="first-name">Deep</div>
    <div class="header">header 1</div>
    <div class="header">header 2</div>
</body>
```

### üìòWhats nodeType, nodeValue, nodeName

1. nodeType

   * What it is: A property of a DOM (Document Object Model) node.

   * What it does: Tells you what kind of node it is.

   * Types of values:
        * 1: Element (like \<div>, \<p>)

        * 3: Text (the text inside an element)
        * 8: Comment (a comment in the HTML, like \<!-- comment -->)

        Example:

        ```js
        Copy code
        let element = document.getElementById('myElement');
        console.log(element.nodeType); // 1 for element
        ```

2. nodeName

   * What it is: Another property of a DOM node.

   * What it does: Gives you the name of the node.

   * For an element: It's the tag name (like DIV, P).

   * For a text node: It's #text.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    Copy code
    let element = document.getElementById('myElement');
    console.log(element.nodeName); // 'DIV' if the element is a <div>
    ```
3. nodeValue

   * What it is: A property of a DOM node.

   * What it does: Contains the value of the node.

   * For a text node: It's the text content.

   * For an element: It's usually null.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   Copy code
   let textNode = document.createTextNode('Hello, world!');
   console.log(textNode.nodeValue); // 'Hello, world!'
   ```

**Quick Summary** (you can check on internet)

* **nodeType**: Tells you what kind of node it is (e.g., element, text).
  * 1 : Element
  * 2 : Attr
  * 3 : Text
  * 8 : Comment
  * 9 : Document

* **nodeName**: Tells you the name of the node (e.g., DIV, #text).

* **nodeValue**: Holds the value of the node (e.g., the text in a text node).


**‚ö†Ô∏èNote :** 

* Use **tagName** when you specifically need to work with element tags.

* Use **nodeName** when you need to identify the type of any node in the DOM.

### üìòDifference between HTML Collection and NodeList

1. **Html Collection :** 
   1. can contains only one type of node, and that one type of node is element node. 

2. **Node List :** 
   1. can contains any NodeType. That means with its collection it can text nodes, comments nodes, elements nodes etc.


**Major Difference between them**

1. Html Collection can be accessed by their name, by the id or by the index number within that collection

2. A Node list item though can only be accessed by their index number

3. (Major one) HTML collections are live and node list items are typically static


Example

* Html Collection Example

```html
<!-- This will add element into live html -->
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
<script>
    let listItem = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
    console.log('Length', listItem.length)
    listItem[0].parentNode.appendChild(document.createElement('li'));
    console.log('Html Collection', listItem);
    console.log('Length', listItem.length)
</script>
```
![Image](./images/html-collections.png)


* NodeList Example

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
<script>
    let listItem = document.querySelectorAll('li');
    console.log('Length', listItem.length)
    listItem[0].parentNode.appendChild(document.createElement('li'));

    console.log('Html Collection', listItem);

    console.log('Length', listItem.length)

</script>
```

### üìòDOM Traversing

* DOM traversing is the process of moving through the HTML structure (Document Object Model) to access and manipulate different elements and nodes. This can include moving up to parent elements, down to child elements, or across to sibling elements.

* Before understand Traversing you need to understand DOM Tree family. There are three types of nodes in the DOM can be expressed as parents, children and siblings

---

### üìòMost 3 Objects in DOM Traversing

 Best Example to Understand DOM Tree (parent, child, siblings)
    
![Image](./images/dom-best-example.png)


Three objects

* **window :** Which is accessible on global level 
* **document :** which is accessible on global level and will returns all dom 
* **document.documentElement** which will return all written Html element

![Image](./images/dom-3-objects.png)


### üìòAccessing Nodes

1. **To Access Parent**

    | Sr No | property/Method Name        | Detail           |
    | ----- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
    | 1     | document.body.parentNode    | Return html node |
    | 2     | document.body.parentElement | Return html node |


2. **To First and last Child**

    | Sr No | property/Method Name | Detail                      |
    | ----- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | 1     | .firstElementChild   | Return first element (best) |
    | 2     | .firstChild          | Return child node           |
    | 3     | .lastElementChild    | Return last (best)element   |
    | 4     | .lastChild           | Return last node            |

    **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**

    * If element don't have any child then it will return empty HtmlCollection

    * If element have only child then his first & last child will be same.

    * If element have more then one then it will return HtmlCollection 


3. **To Access all Children**


    | Sr No | property/Method Name | Detail                                                  |
    | ----- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 1     | .children            | Return all children element with html Collection (best) |
    | 2     | .childNodes          | Return child node                                       |



4. **To Access Sibling**

    | Sr No | property/Method Name    | Detail                         |
