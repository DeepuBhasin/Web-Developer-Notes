#The 3 Tasks PHP Does :
	1. We query the database & connect to it.
	2. We handle data submitted by users.
	3. We Show DB data to the users. 


#OOPs Topics 
	1. Classes and Objects 
	2. Access Specifiers(Visibility) and Inheritance 
	3.

Note 1. List()
		
		The list() function is used to assign values to a list of variables in one operation.Prior to PHP 7.1, this function only worked on numerical arrays.	

		#Example

			$my_array = array("Dog","Cat","Horse");

			list($a, $b, $c) = $my_array;
			echo "I have several animals, a $a, a $b and a $c.";

		#Output
		=======

			I have several animals, a Dog, a Cat and a Horse.	

	2. Strtr

		The strtr() function translates certain characters in a string.Note: If the from and to parameters are different in length, both will be formatted to the length of the shortest.	

		#Example

			echo strtr("Hilla Warld","ia","eo");

		#Output
		=======

			Hello World
