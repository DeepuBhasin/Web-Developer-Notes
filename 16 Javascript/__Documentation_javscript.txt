    1. Scripting refers to a series of commands that are interperated and executed sequentially and immediately on occurrance of an event 
    2. This is event action generated by a user while interacting with a web page.
    3. Example of events includes button clicks, selecting a product from a menu, and so on. 
    4. A scripting language refers to a set of instructions that provides some functionality when the user intrects with a web page. 
    5. scripting languages are often  embedded in the Html pages to changes the behaviour of the web pages according to the user's requirments
    6. The first javscript engine was created by brenden eich in 1995 at netscape, for the netscape navigator web browser 

    There are two types of scripting languages.
        1. Client-side Scripting

    1. Javascript is a scripting language that allows buiding dynamic web pages by ensuring maximum user interactivity
    2. Javascript language is an object-based langauge, which means that it provides object for specifying functionalities.  

    Note : 1. Document                   :: is a root object which contains all html 
           2. document.write('hello')    :: this function allow to write any thing on the html page

#DATA TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT

    There are 2 Data types 
        1. Primitive Data type 
            a. Boolen 
            b. Null

            c. Arrays  

        Note :  1. typeOf           :: print the variable Type 
                2. parseInt         :: convert any Datatype into Integer

#Objects 
    
    1. var obj = new object();                              //creating object

        obj.name="Deepinder";                           //creating property     
        obj.phone=9915099247;                           //creating property  
        obj.run=function{                               //creating function / method  
            return obj.name + "is Running";             // returning value      
        }

        Acessing Variable 
            obj.name                                // Deepinder
            obj.run();                              // Deepinder is Running 

    2. var bike {                                       //createing object 
        name : "aulto",                                 // creating property     
        color : "black",                                // creating property 
        company : "amruti",                             // creating property 
        price   : 50000,
        discount : function(){                          // creating function/method 
        var amount = bike.price-5000;
        }
    }

#DOM
    
    1. When a webpage or html page loads the browsers, Browser create a DOM (Document Object Model) for the page.

    3. Dom is a standard to understand the structure of the html page so that we can create, Read, Update and Delete and manages DOM Elements using javscript methods 

    4. Html DOM helps you to understand and control the element structure using javscript methods. if you understand the Dom Structure of the Html page, You can easily control it elements, Attribute and all Nodes 

    #What is Node ? 

        1. According the Html Dom Every thing in a html page is node 
        2. Entire Document is a Document Node.
