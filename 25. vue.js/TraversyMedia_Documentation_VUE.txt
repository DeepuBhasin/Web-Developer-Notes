#What is Vue 

    1. Vue is Front end javascript framework for building websites and user interfaces 
    2. Vue is generally use to create single-page apps that run on the client, but can be used to create full stack application by makking HTTP request to a backend server. Vue is popular with Node.js and Express (MEVN Stack)
    3. Vue can also run on the server-side by using a SSR framework like Nuxt

#Why Use Vue

#What should you know first ?

    Like with any framework, you should be comfortable with the underlying language first. In this case, that in javascript

        1. javscript Fundamentals  
        2. Async Programming (promises)
        3. Array Methods (forEach, map, Filter, etc)
        4. Fetch Api / HTTP Requests 
        5. NPM (node package manager)

#Working with State/Data 

    Components can have their own state which can determine how a specific component behaves and what data is displayed 

    Some State may be local to a specific component and some may be "global" or "app" level state that needs to be shared with multiple components 

    Vuex is state manager for global state in larger applications 


#Options API vs Composition API 

    Vue 3 has the Composition API, which aims to address code resusability and readability in Vue 3, especially in larger applications

    I will be creating a separate video to demonstarte the Composition API. We will be using the traditional options API in this crash course (Vue 2 and Vue 3)

#Vue CLI 

    Standard Tooling for vue.js development 

    1. Command line interface for creating Vue apps 
    2. Dev server and easy Production build 
    3. Optional GUI for managing Vue Projects 
    4. Integrated testing, TypeScript Support, ESlint and more



    Note : 

        <h1>{{firstName}}</h1>                      // print firstName property 

        <p v-bind:data-id="firstName"> </p>         // print firstName (same) property
